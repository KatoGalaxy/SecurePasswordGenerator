For legal(?) reasons: This isn't actually that secure. It's just called that because that is what I am forced to call it.

Simple Python program that creates a randomly generated password. It works like this:
1. To start, enter the total number of characters the password should have (8-128)
2. Enter how many of those characters should be letters, digits or special characters. (If any characters are left unused after this step, their type will be randomly chosen)
3. The password is generated, and will be displayed in the console and also written to a file named "password.txt" (If there is already a file, it will be overwritten with the new password)
